My heart rages around
like an ocean in my head
Because there are so many things
that I left unsaid
I can almost feel you
walking in the distance
But I know that is not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
all along
Know I'll find you in my dreams
Find you in my
Walking in the distance
That is not reality
My heart rages around
like an ocean in my head
I can almost feel you
walking in the distance
But I know that is not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
all along
Know I'll find you in my dreams
Find you in my
Walking in the distance
That is not reality
Find you in my
Find you in my
Walking in the distance
That is not reality
I can almost feel you
walking in the distance
But I know that is not reality
